**Caching Proxy CLI**
Caching Proxy CLI is a command-line tool that runs a caching proxy server. It forwards requests to the actual server and stores responses. If the same request is made again, the cached response is returned instead of forwarding the request, reducing network load and improving efficiency.

Features
🚀 Forwards requests to the actual server
⚡ Caches responses to reduce redundant requests
🔄 Serves cached responses for repeated requests
🛠️ Command-line interface for easy usage
